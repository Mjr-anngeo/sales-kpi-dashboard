# Insightful Sales BI Dashboard
# Description : This project focuses on building an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI, designed to visualize key sales metrics and provide actionable insights for sales teams, business analysts, and decision-makers. By leveraging the powerful visualization tools in Power BI, this dashboard helps businesses track sales performance, monitor progress against sales targets, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

The project involves importing, cleaning, and transforming sales data from various sources (e.g., CRM systems, Excel files, and ERP platforms) into a unified data model. The dashboard includes a variety of visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and maps, along with key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, sales growth, regional performance, top-performing products, and sales vs. target comparisons.
